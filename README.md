# ðŸŽ¨ Color Switcher

A simple and elegant web app that lets users change the background color of the page by clicking on color buttons. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling in a visually pleasing way.
## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The page displays a few circular buttons.
- Each button has a unique ID corresponding to a color (`grey`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`).
- When a user clicks a button, JavaScript captures the click event and sets the `body`'s background color based on the button's ID.
